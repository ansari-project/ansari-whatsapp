# Moreover, if want to test whatsapp's webhook locally, you can use zrok on a reserved URL with a zrok "share token"
# obtained by contacting its current holder: https://github.com/OdyAsh (source 1, 2 below)
# Alternatively, you can change the webhook url all together (source 3, 4 below)
# Check these sources for more details:
# Source 1: https://dev.to/odyash/quickly-share-your-app-with-zrok-4ihp
# Source 2: https://openziti.discourse.group/t/how-do-i-use-a-reserved-share-on-different-devices/2379/2
# Source 3: https://youtu.be/KP6_BUw3i0U?t=1294
#   (@21:33 and 25:30, however they use glitch instead of zrok, so the video here is just to give you an idea how to setup a webhook)
# Source 4 (where you can change callback url, given that your facebook account gets access by the app's admins):
#   https://developers.facebook.com/apps/871020755148175/whatsapp-business/wa-settings/
#   NOTE 1: Obviously, that `871020755148175` in the above URL is the testing app's public id, so if this link still doesn't work even after you gain access,
#   then the admins most probably created a new test app instance
#   NOTE 2: When you see the `Callback URL`, it will be something like "https://META_WEBHOOK_ZROK_SHARE_TOKEN.share.zrok.io/whatsapp/v2"
#           (The `/whatsapp/v2` endpoint can be found in `main.py`'s endpoints, that's why it's in the url above)
#           Moreover, this zrok callback URL is only used for `Ansari Test` app on developers.facebook.com,
#           so we should only use it while locally developing this repo, not in staging/prod/etc. environments
#   NOTE 3: If an unexpected 3rd party discovers the META_WEBHOOK_ZROK_SHARE_TOKEN,
#   a new one will have to be generated, then added to Meta's callback URL of the *testing* app
#   (Noting that the *production* app's callback URL will be different anyway, so the 3rd party won't be able to access that app)
#   (but we still don't want random calls to be made to our testing app, so that's why we'll still have to change an exposed token :])
#       Side note: the current zrok instance (i.e., "https://META_WEBHOOK_ZROK_SHARE_TOKEN.share.zrok.io")
#                   currently proxies (i.e., maps to) this local address: http://127.0.0.1:8001
#                   Therefore, if for some reason, you want to change that address,
#                   then you'll need to re-establish the mapping by doing these 2 commands:
#                   `zrok release <<META_WEBHOOK_ZROK_SHARE_TOKEN>>`
#                   `zrok reserve public XXXX --unique-name "<<META_WEBHOOK_ZROK_SHARE_TOKEN>>"`
#                   where XXXX is your new port number (which correspond to the PORT variable found in `.env` file)

# Phone number ID (from Meta Dashboard)
# NOTE 1: Contact the team to see whatsapp's 2 phone nums -> one for prod. env. and the other for local/stage testing
# NOTE 2: If you encounter this error: 
#   "Client error '400 Bad Request' for url 'https://graph.facebook.com/v22.0/<WHATSAPP_BUSINESS_PHONE_NUMBER_ID>/messages'"
#   then either:
#       (1) the <WHATSAPP_BUSINESS_PHONE_NUMBER_ID> got deleted by Meta due to inactive use for a long time.
#           If this happens, then open the page in source 3 (i.e., youtube video URL above) @6:11. 
#           Then, under "step 1" in the middle of the page, you'll see a selection box with the live WhatsApp number;
#           click on it, then click "Get new test number". Then, wait for a while, then you'll see the new number; 
#           Now copy its number id and paste it in <WHATSAPP_BUSINESS_PHONE_NUMBER_ID>
#       (2) Meta updated its version and so now <WHATSAPP_API_VERSION> is outdated.
#           You can verify this by opening source 3 @26:13 and checking the version associated with `messages`
#       (3) you sent a message with an incorrect format. Check source 3; 26:10->26:28, click on `messages` to see how it should be sent
